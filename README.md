ASP.NET Identity Examples
=========================

I've tried several times to understand the new ASP.NET Identity infrastructure,
and each time I feel like I get the idea but I'm lost in all the details. None
of the guides I can find online seem to fully explain what I want to know.

So, these examples are for myself, to remind myself how to do specific things
with ASP.NET Identity. It's my best understanding of what the infrastructure is
doing for me.

I've consulted the source code of the various projects while writing this:

* [ASP.NET Identity][aspnetidentity]
* [Katana Project][katana], for all the Microsoft OWIN libraries

[aspnetidentity]: https://asp.net/identity
[katana]: https://katanaproject.codeplex.com
